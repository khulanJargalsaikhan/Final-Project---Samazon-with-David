Sam has been saving all his money and now wants to create an online store. And you're going to help him.

Your job is to find at least twenty products for him to sell. Then create a database for those products. Next, create a web application to serve as a shopping cart for the online store.

Your application should allow the user to view a list of products with pictures and select a product to add to the shopping cart.

Each product should contain a name, description and price and any other information you want to add. The products must be stored in the database. The images may use cloudinary or urls. After the application is complete you will be adding a new product and removing a product from the database. This change should not break your application. Only the Admin can add products. Also the Admin can change the price or put something on sale.

The user should be able to browse the list, see product details and add the product to their cart. Then the user can go back to the list and shop more or can go to the cart to checkout.

The site must use Bootstrap and include a navbar which shows on all pages when the user is logged in.

Plan your site first!!

So, you should have the following pages:

- Product List Page
- Product Details Page
- Shopping Cart Page that shows all the items in the shopping cart
- Order Confirmation  that shows the total amount of the items ordered. Users should receive an email confirmation of their order which details items purchased and total cost.
- User Details page that shows the user information and their order history
- Login levels for users and administrators. Administrators can add and edit products and change prices.
- User's name and number of items in their cart should appear on every page. Optionally you can list the total value of their cart.
- Sites should charge shipping on every order but offer free shipping for orders > $50.00.
- Search form in the navbar which allows the user to search for items in the store or their order history. You can decide how you want to present the results. User should be able to search for products containing any or all the words entered.
